# Fluid Settings
#
# The following are basic settings for the fluid-settings environment
# Note that most settings are managed by the Fluid Settings daemon so
# here the number of settings is very minimal.

# snapcommunicator=<ip>:<port>
#
# The IP address and port the snapcommunicator daemon uses to connect.
#
# The fluid-settings daemon connects to the snapcommunicator using this
# information. Once connected, all the other services can access the
# fluid-settings daemon via their local snapcommunicator.
